## Key Patterns

- **No goto** — use `repeat/until` loops for retries. Goto breaks the web build.
- **Logic/visual separation** — data modules (`currency`, `upgrades`, `game_2048`, `powerups`) have zero drawing code; screen modules handle all rendering.
- **Module exports** — each module returns a table of public functions.
- **Iterator** — `utils.each_coin(boxes)` for coin traversal.
- **Immediate-mode UI** — buttons drawn as rectangles, hit-tested on mouse click.

## Rendering

1080x2400 virtual canvas (portrait) with letterboxing. Screen-to-game coord conversion via `ox`, `oy`, `scale` in `main.lua`. Coin style toggle: `layout.USE_FRUIT_IMAGES` (`false` = tinted `ball.png`, `true` = per-color fruit PNGs).

## Screen System

Each screen is a table with optional methods: `enter()`, `exit()`, `update(dt)`, `draw()`, `mousepressed(x, y, button)`, `keypressed(key, scancode, isrepeat)`.

**Screens:** `mode_select`, `game` (classic), `game_2048` (default start), `game_over`, `upgrades`

**Adding a new screen:**
1. Create `my_screen.lua` with screen table and methods
2. Add `my_screen.init(assets)` to receive shared assets
3. In `main.lua`, require, init, and register with `screens.register()`
4. Add a button in `mode_select` to switch to it (with `unlock_key` if lockable)

## Screen Flow (Roguelike Loop)

```
[App Start] -> [game_2048] <------ [upgrades "Play"]
                   |                      ^
             [all boxes full,             |
              no merges possible]         |
                   |                      |
                   v                      |
             [game_over]                  |
                   |                      |
             ["Continue"] ----------------+
```

1. `game_2048_screen.enter()` recalculates grid from upgrades, inits game, resets run shards
2. Play until `game_2048.isGameOver()` (checked after flight landing, deal completion, merge completion)
3. `game_over_screen` shows run stats, "Continue" goes to `upgrades_screen`
4. "Play" starts a new run with the upgraded grid

**House production** ticks on ALL screens via `upgrades.updateProduction(dt)`. On upgrades screen, production events trigger flying crystal animations.

## Animation System

See `animation.lua` for all config constants and math formulas.

**Dual-track architecture** — two independent state tracks run simultaneously:
- **Pick track:** IDLE → HOVERING → FLYING (player interaction)
- **Background track:** IDLE → MERGING → DEALING (automated)

Players can pick/place coins while merge/dealing animations play in the background. Boxes currently being merged (`getMergeLockedBoxes()`) are excluded from interaction.

**Hover/Flight flow:**
1. Click box with coins → `startHover()` → coins bob and spread
2. Click destination → `startFlight()` → coins arc to target, drop one by one
3. Each landing triggers `coinLandCallback` (adds coin, plays sound)
4. All landed → `callback` fires → IDLE

**Return-to-source:** clicking the source box while hovering returns coins via `animation.getSourceBox()`.

**Merge flow (both modes):**
1. Call `getMergeableBoxes()` on the game module
2. Pass to `startMerge(merge_data, onComplete, onBoxMerge, particles)`
3. Per box (sequentially with delay): coins slide up one-by-one with particles + shake, `onBoxMerge` callback updates game state, new coin pops with elastic bounce
4. All done → `onComplete()` → IDLE

**Dealing flow (poker dealer style):**
1. Call `calculateCoinsToAdd()` to pre-calculate destinations
2. `startDealing()` — coins fly from bottom center to destination boxes with spin
3. Each landing triggers `onCoinLand`, all done triggers `onComplete`

**Screen shake:** intensity scales with merge progress (40% → 100%). Apply via `love.graphics.translate(animation.getScreenShake())` inside `push()`/`pop()`.

## Layout System

See `layout.lua` for all static values and metric formulas.

**Progressive grid scaling:** `layout.getGridMetrics(cols, rows)` computes all sizing. After calling `layout.applyMetrics()`, you MUST call `graphics.updateMetrics()` and `input.updateMetrics()` to refresh cached values. (`animation.lua` reads layout globals directly — no refresh needed.)

**Two-layer depth mode (poker-chip stacking):**
- Activates at `rows >= TWO_LAYER_THRESHOLD` (default 8)
- Pairs slots into visual rows: odd slots = back layer (offset up-left), even = front (offset down-right)
- `graphics.drawCoins2048` renders back layer first for proper z-order

**Multi-row column layout:**
- Activates at `cols >= MULTI_ROW_THRESHOLD` (default 7)
- Wraps columns into 2 visual rows, `column_step` uses `cols_per_row` so coins stay large
- `layout.columnPosition(column)` transparently handles row wrapping
- Can combine with two-layer mode (7+ cols AND 8+ rows)

## Classic Mode (game.lua)

Coins are color strings. Full box with all same colors → cleared, points awarded with combo multiplier. See module for full API.

**Animated merge:** `getMergeableBoxes()` → `animation.startMerge()` → `executeMergeOnBox(box_idx, combo)` callback per box.

## 2048 Mode (game_2048.lua)

Coins are `{number=N}`, 5 cycling colors via `coin_utils.numberToColor()`. Placement: same number or empty slot only. Full box of same number → `MERGE_OUTPUT` (2) coins of number+1. See module for all balance constants.

**Two-cap progression system:**
- Buffer cap: `floor(COLS * 0.70) + difficulty_extra_types` (hard cap: cols-1)
- Progression cap: `min(10, 3 + floor(merges/10))`
- `max_spawn_number = min(progression_cap, buffer_cap)`

**Dealing algorithm (`computeDeal()`):**
- Initial deal: `2 * BOX_ROWS` coins, uniform types. Regular: `BOX_ROWS * uniform(0.5, 0.9)` with weighted distribution.
- Sparse board bonus: when fill < 30%, deal lerps toward `2 * BOX_ROWS` (0% fill → full initial size)
- 36% chance to skip each type per deal for variety. Lower numbers weighted heavier.

**Max coin tracking:** both `executeMergeOnBox()` and `merge()` call `upgrades.setMaxCoinReached(n)`. On `init()`, `max_spawn_number` boosted to `max(2, max_coin_reached - 2)`.

**Game over:** only when ALL boxes full AND no merges possible.

## Currency (currency.lua)

5 shard colors (red/green/purple/blue/pink). Merges award `floor(coin_count * 5 * shard_bonus)` shards. 25 shards auto-convert to 1 crystal. Per-run tracking reset with `currency.startRun()`. Persisted via progression.

## Upgrades (upgrades.lua)

**Flat cost:** all upgrades cost `{red=1, green=1}` crystals. Base grid: 4x4, max: 15 cols x 10 rows.

**House unlock (hidden feature):**
- Houses hidden until player spends rainbow cost (1 crystal of each of 5 colors)
- Before unlock: mystery progress bar (0-5 colors) with lock icon
- On unlock: free house token granted, remaining 5 slots purchasable
- Migration: saves with any built house auto-unlock on init
- When locked, UI elements below house area shift up by 410px via `yoff`

**Houses:** 6 slots (3x2), each produces 0.25 crystals/min of chosen color. Color changeable free.

**Difficulty:** `difficulty_extra_types` adds coin types beyond default buffer cap, shrinks buffer. Shard bonus: +10% per 5% buffer decrease.

## Power-ups (powerups.lua)

- **Auto Sort** — redistributes all coins left-to-right by number type. Cost: `{red=2, green=2}`.
- **Hammer** — clears an entire column. Activates targeting mode (red overlay, click column to clear, Escape to cancel). Cost: `{red=1}`.

Both start at 100 charges (dev/testing). `game_2048.autoSort()` returns dealing animation data. `game_2048.clearColumn(col_idx)` returns removed coins.

## 2048 Gameplay Screen (game_2048_screen.lua)

**Responsive input:** only blocked during coin flight (~0.23s). Players can pick/place during merge/deal. Merge/Add buttons require full idle. Classic mode retains full blocking.

**Reset button** (top-right): hold 3 seconds to reset all progress via `progression.reset()`.

## Assets

- `/sfx/` — sound effects, `/bgnd_music/` — background music
- `/assets/` — sprites: `ball.png` (tinted per color), `Red.png`, `Green.png`, `Purple.png`, `Blue.png`, `Pink.png` (1024x1024 fruit coins with ~200x200 center slot for number)
- `comic shanns.otf` — custom UI font

## Mobile Touch Input

`love.touchpressed` / `love.touchreleased` are intentionally **NOT defined** in `main.lua`. When absent, LÖVE automatically generates synthetic mouse events from touch — giving single-tap = single `mousepressed`. Defining touch callbacks disables this and caused double-fire (pick up + immediate return) on mobile.

**Web touch debounce:** SDL+Emscripten (love.js) fires BOTH a synthetic mouse event (`istouch=true`) AND a duplicate real mouse event (`istouch=false`) for a single touch. `main.lua` debounces this: when `istouch=true`, timestamp is recorded; any non-touch mouse event within 0.2s is ignored.

`game_2048_screen.lua` provides `isPointerDown()` and `getPointerPosition()` helpers that check both `love.mouse` and `love.touch` for extra robustness.

## Platform Detection (mobile.lua)

- `mobile.isMobile()` — native mobile only (Android/iOS). Use for fullscreen, vibration.
- `mobile.isWeb()` — web builds (`love.system.getOS() == "Web"`).
- `mobile.isLowPerformance()` — true for both native mobile AND web. Use for all performance optimizations (FPS cap, particle reduction).

## Mobile/Web Performance

- **FPS cap**: 30 FPS render throttle on `isLowPerformance()` platforms via canvas caching in `main.lua`. Game logic runs at full rate for responsive input; only the canvas re-render is throttled. The cached canvas is blitted every frame (single cheap draw call). `love.timer.sleep()` is NOT used (doesn't work on web/Emscripten).
- **Particles**: `particles.lua` uses `mobile.isLowPerformance()` and halves particle counts (150 max, 10 per burst, 18 per merge), reduces lifetime/bounces, and skips the per-particle highlight sub-rectangle.
- **Canvas**: `{dpiscale = 1}` prevents oversized textures on HiDPI mobile GPUs.

## FPS Counter

Drawn inside the virtual canvas (bottom-left corner) in `main.lua`'s `love.draw()`, using a 24px font. Always visible on all screens.

## Keyboard Shortcuts
- `\` — quit, `Escape` — upgrades screen (from game)
